# Configurations

## Helm Chart values

Read [Helm Chart](helm.md) for details.

## Configuration file

[`accurate-controller`](accurate-controller.md) reads its configurations from a configuration file.

The repository includes an example as follows:

```yaml
# Labels to be propagated to sub-namespaces.
# It is also possible to specify a glob pattern that can be interpreted by Go's "path.Match" func.
# https://pkg.go.dev/path#Match
labelKeys:
- team

# Annotations to be propagated to sub-namespaces.
# It is also possible to specify a glob pattern that can be interpreted by Go's "path.Match" func.
# https://pkg.go.dev/path#Match
annotationKeys:
# An example to propagate an annotation for MetalLB
# https://metallb.universe.tf/usage/#requesting-specific-ips
- metallb.universe.tf/address-pool

# List of GVK for namespace-scoped resources that can be propagated.
# Any namespace-scoped resource is allowed.
watches:
- group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  version: v1
  kind: Role
- group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  version: v1
  kind: RoleBinding
- version: v1
  kind: Secret
- version: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota

# List of nameing policy for SubNamespaces.
# root and match are both regular expressions.
# When a SubNamespace is created in a tree starting from a root namespace and the root namespace's name matches the "root" regular expression, the SubNamespace name is validated with the "match" regular expression.
#
# "match" namingPolicies can use variables of regexp capture group naming of "root" namingPolicies.
# example:
#   root: ^app-(?P<team>.*)
#   match: ^app-${team}-.*
#   root namespace: app-team1
#   compiled match naming policy: ^app-team1-.*
# This feature is provided using https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.Expand
namingPolicies: []
```

Only labels and annotations specified in the configuration file will be inherited.

Likewise, Accurate watches only namespace-scope resources specified in the configuration file.

You can edit the Helm Chart values as needed.

```yaml
<snip>
controller:
  config:
    # controller.config.labelKeys -- Labels to be propagated to sub-namespaces.
    # It is also possible to specify a glob pattern that can be interpreted by Go's "path.Match" func.
    ## https://pkg.go.dev/path#Match

      - version: v1
        kind: Secret

    # This feature is provided using https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.Expand
    namingPolicies:
      - root:  foo
        match: foo_.*
      - root:  bar
        match: bar_.*
      - root:  ^app-(?P<team>.*)
        match: ^app-${team}-.*

## ClusterRoleBindings

A built-in ClusterRole `admin` is bound by default to allow `accurate-controller` to watch and propagate namespace-scope resources. However, `admin` does not contain verbs for [ResourceQuota][] and may not contain custom resources.

If you need to watch and propagate resources not included in `admin` ClusterRole, add additional ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding to `accurate-controller-manager` ServiceAccount.
Set the `controller.additionalRBAC.rules` in the Helm Chart values.

The following example Helm chart values is to watch and propagate ResourceQuotas.

```yaml
<snip>
controller:
  additionalRBAC:
    # controller.additionalRBAC.rules -- Specify the RBAC rules to be added to the controller.
    # ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding are created with the names `{{ release name }}-additional-resources`.
    # The rules defined here will be used for the ClusterRole rules.
    rules:
      - apiGroups:
          - ""
        resources:
          - resourcequotas
        verbs:
          - get
          - list
          - watch
          - create
          - update
          - patch
          - delete
<snip>
```
