# Release procedure

This document describes how to release a new version.

## Labeling

Release notes are automatically generated based on PRs included in the release.
Those PRs are categorized based on the label assigned to them.
Please refer to `.github/release.yml` for the kind of labels.

## Versioning

Follow [semantic versioning 2.0.0][semver] to choose the new version number.

## Bump version

1. Determine a new version number. Then set `VERSION` variable.

    ```bash
    # Set VERSION and confirm it. It should not have "v" prefix.
    VERSION=x.y.z
    echo $VERSION
    ```

2. Add a git tag to the main HEAD, then push it.

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull
    git tag -a -m "Release v$VERSION" "v$VERSION"
    git tag -ln | grep $VERSION
    git push origin v$VERSION
    ```
