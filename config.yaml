# List of nameing policy for SubNamespaces.
# root and match are both regular expressions.
# When a SubNamespace is created in a tree starting from a root namespace and the root namespace's name matches the "root" regular expression, the SubNamespace name is validated with the "match" regular expression.
#
# "match" namingPolicies can use variables of regexp capture group naming of "root" namingPolicies.
# example:
#   root: ^app-(?P<team>.*)
#   match: ^app-${team}-.*
#   root namespace: app-team1
#   compiled match naming policy: ^app-team1-.*
# This feature is provided using https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.Expand
