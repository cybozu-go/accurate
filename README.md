# Accurate

Accurate is a Kubernetes controller for soft multi-tenancy environments.

Accurate resembles [Hierarchical Namespace Controller (HNC)][HNC].
It propagates resources between namespaces and allows tenant users to create/delete sub-namespaces.

## Features

- Resource propagation between namespaces
    - Any namespace-scoped resource can be propagated.
    - ⚠️ Generated resources can be automatically checked and propagated. (DEPRECATED)
- Inheriting labels and annotations from parent namespaces
- Template namespaces
- SubNamespace custom resource for tenant users
- `kubectl` plugin

## Comparison to Hierarchical Namespace Controller (HNC)

Both Accurate and HNC aim the same goal -- to provide better namespace usability on soft multi-tenancy Kubernetes environments.

Accurate is more accurate than HNC in propagating resources because Accurate adopts an opt-in manner while HNC adopts an opt-out manner.
With Accurate, only resources annotated with `accurate.cybozu.com/propagate` will be propagated.
With HNC, all resources will be propagated except for ones that are specially annotated.

Suppose you want to propagate only [a Secret for pulling private images](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/).
With HNC, this can be quite difficult because Secrets are often generated from another resource.
Such generated Secrets are often not possible to have custom annotations.
As a consequence, such Secrets would be propagated to sub-namespaces, which may cause security problems.

There are many other differences between Accurate and HNC.
Please check them in [the documentation][doc].

## Demo

Run and try Accurate on a [kind (Kubernetes-In-Docker)][kind] cluster as follows:

1. Prepare a Linux box running Docker.
2. Checkout this repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cybozu-go/accurate
    ```

3. Install [aqua][].

    ```bash
    go install github.com/aquaproj/aqua/v2/cmd/aqua@latest
    ```

    cf. <https://aquaproj.github.io/docs/install>

4. Go to `e2e` directory, setup shell variables, and execute `make start`.

    ```bash
    cd e2e
    PATH=$(cd ..; pwd)/bin:$PATH
    KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/.kubeconfig
    export KUBECONFIG
    make start
    ```

5. Create a root namespace and a sub-namespace using `kubectl accurate`.

    ```bash
    kubectl create ns root1
    kubectl accurate ns set-type root1 root
    kubectl accurate sub create sub1 root1
    kubectl accurate list
    kubectl accurate ns describe root1
    kubectl accurate ns describe sub1
    ```

6. Create a Secret in `root1` and see it will be propagated to `sub1`.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n root1 create secret generic s1 --from-literal=foo=bar
    kubectl -n root1 annotate secrets s1 accurate.cybozu.com/propagate=update
    sleep 1
    kubectl -n sub1 get secrets
    ```

7. Stop the kind cluster.

    ```bash
    make stop
    ```
